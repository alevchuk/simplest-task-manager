AOL are my initials (first, middle, and last name)
so when my boss or I what to get me a new task, we just run:
  aol

This creates a new unique task id (e.g. aol003) and puts it 
as the first line in the tasks file with a today's date and
opens that file in vi.

There is a lot of freedom on how to format the file.

Move lines (of sets of lines) up and down to indicate the task priority.

A section on the bottom of the file where closed tasks are placed.
Section are separated by double newlines.

The tasks id are meant to be assisted with emails and made searchable so I
plan to forward request emails with the new task id to my boss and ask him
to do then same when giving me new assignments and to move things in the
tasks file according to priority.


Example

The TODO file has the syntax of simplest-task-manager.
