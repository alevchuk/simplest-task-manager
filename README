AOL are my initials (first, middle, and last name)
so when my boss or I what to get me a new task, we just run:
  aol

This creates a new unique task id (e.g. aol003) and puts it 
as the first line in the tasks file with a today's date and
opens that file in Vim.

There is a lot of freedom on how to format the file. Here is what I do...
(but it's in a text editor so you can do anything else):
 * I move lines (or sets of lines) up and down to indicate the task priority.
 * I have a section on the bottom of the file where closed tasks are placed.
 * I separate sections by double newlines.
 * My Munin monitor graphs counts of tasks in different sections.

The tasks ids can be placed in emails and are unique (searchable).

Please so the TODO file. It has the shape of a simplest-task-manager file.
