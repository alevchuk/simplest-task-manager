A very simple human task management.

"aol" are my name initials,
so when my boss or I what to assign a new task for me we just run:
  aol

This creates a new unique task id (e.g. aol003) and puts it 
as the first line in the tasks file with a today's date and
opens that file in vi.

There is complete freedom on how to format the file.

We plan to move lines (of sets of lines) up and down
to indicate the task priority.

There will be a section on the bottom of the file where
closed tasks are placed.

The tasks id are meant to be assisted with emails and made searchable so I
plan to forward request emails with the new task id to my boss and ask him
to do then same when giving me new assignments and to move things in the
tasks file according to priority.


REQUIREMENTS
############

Bash is the only software requirement.

Once the unique task id is in the file, it should not be removed,
otherwise the generator may produce a non-unique tasks id.
