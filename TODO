aol003 (opened: Wed 25-05-2011) CRON checker to email when a changed happens
aol002 (opened: Wed 25-05-2011) If nothing was added to the first line then
  don't keep it. The first line is the new task. I found myself typing "aol"
  just to check the list. It that case I don't need to add the new task. So
  I had to delete it every time. So it's best just not to add it if it's empty.
aol004 (opened: Wed 25-05-2011) Manually created. Just for the heck of it.
